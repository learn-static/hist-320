This week you'll continue writing your in-progress multimedia essay, using the skills you've learned throughout your recent Labs.

Please include at least **two** visualizations into your Essay in Progress:
***This can be two topic graphs, two Voyant visualizations, or one topic graph and one Voyant visualization. Whatever supports your argument the best!***

You can include *more* than two visualizations if you'd like, but the minimum should be two.

Write your essay content into the `essay-01.md` file, just as we have our practice content the past couple weeks.
Right now you likely have a lot of extra material in your `essay-01.md` file.
It will probably help you to delete most of it, but be sure that you *don't* delete the following:

**Don't Delete** the frontmatter at the top of your page:

```

**Don't Delete** the "Notes" heading, towards the bottom of your page. 
You'll add all of your citations below this "Notes" heading:

`## Notes`

You **may or may not** want to delete the table of contents at the top of the page. 
This is up to you!
To delete it, simply this line of text from your `essay-01.md` file:

`{% raw %}{% include feature/nav-menu.html sections="Introduction;Conclusion;Notes" %}{% endraw %}`

If you've done the last two Labs, you've added at least one topic graph, like this:

`{% raw %}{% include feature/line-chart.html data="sotu-20th-century" topic="Example Topic" %}{% endraw %}`

and one Voyant visualization, like this:

``

If these are the visualizations you'd like to use as supporting evidence for your essay, then keep them in your `essay-01.md` file!

Or, if you want to include other visualizations, follow the steps from the [Topic Modeling](/topic-modeling.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Voyant Image Includes](/includes.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} Labs to create new visualizations that support your topic.

## Some tips and clarifications

**Editing permissions**:
- When you post your essay's URL to the Lab Discussion, your classmates can *look* at your site, but they *cannot edit* it. Only you, as the owner of your GitHub repository, can edit the content on your site.

**Viewing State of the Union and Party Platform full text**:
- Your website comes complete with links to the full text of every State of the Union Address and Party Platform created in the 20th century. Find these links by first locating and clicking on the "Data" tab in your site's navigation menu, then using the "Search" box at the top right of the table to filter by president, candidate, or year. When you click on a documents's link, it will take you to the full text hosted by the University of California Santa Barbaraâ€™s [American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
